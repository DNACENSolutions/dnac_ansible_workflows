#           Note: Onboarding templates cannot be modified after assignment.
#           To update onboarding templates, the profile must be deleted and re-created with
#           the desired templates due to API/SDK limitations.
#         type: list

#         required: false
#       additional_interfaces:
#         description: |
#           Specifies additional interfaces to be added to this wireless profile.
#           If the specified interface name and VLAN ID do not exist, they will be created.
#           Note: Additional interfaces cannot be modified after assignment.
#           To update additional interfaces, the profile must be deleted and re-created with
#           the new interfaces due to API/SDK limitations.
#         type: list
