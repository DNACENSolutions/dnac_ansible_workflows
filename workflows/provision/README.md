# Provision Workflow Playbook
This workflow playbook automates the process of assigning device to sites, provisioning, reprovisioning and deleting devices in Cisco DNA (Catalyst Center) inventory.
It is supported from Catalyst Center Release version 2.3.7.6

## Workflow Main Tasks
- **Site Assignment**: Assign a device to a site_hierarchy without provisioning
- **Device Provision**: Assign a device to site and provision.
- **Device Re-Provision**: Re-provision an already provisioned device.
- **Device Un-Provision**: Remove a provisioned device from the inventory.

#### To run this workflow, follow the README.md instruction

## Procedure 

### 1. Prepare Your Ansible Environment
- Install ansible if you haven't already installed (recommend ansible:9.9.0 or higher)
- Ensure you have network connectivity to your Catalyst Center instance
- Checkout the project and playbooks: git@github.com:cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-ansible-iac.git

###  2. Configure Hosts Inventory
- Update hosts.yml with the connection details of your DNA Center instance. 

#### The Sample host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml

```bash
catalyst_center_hosts:
    hosts:
        catalyst_center220:
            dnac_host: xx.xx.xx.xx.
            dnac_password: XXXXXXXX
            dnac_port: 443
            dnac_timeout: 60
            dnac_username: admin
            dnac_verify: false
            dnac_version: 2.3.7.6
            dnac_debug: true
            dnac_log_level: INFO
            dnac_log: true
```

#### User Inputs for Users and roles are stored in workflows/provision/vars/provision_workflow_inputs.yml 

### 3. Defining device details 
provision_details section specifies the list of devices and their configurations for the devices to be run through the playbooks.
To configure this, refer to the full workflow specification: [Ansible Galaxy - Provision Workflow Manager](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/cisco/dnac/content/module/provision_workflow_manager/).

### Validate the input file using yamale: (recommended)
```bash
#validates input file against the schema
(pyats) dnac_ansible_workflows % ./tools/validate.sh -s workflows/provision/schema/provision_workflow_schema.yml -d workflows/provision/vars/provision_workflow_inputs.yml
