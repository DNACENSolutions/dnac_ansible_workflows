Operations Overview

## Provisioning:
#### Assigns device to a site and configures them.

step 1: Device is in a non-provisioned state

Provision configuration can be verified in the UI.

### Example:
#### ** Input (YAML) **
```bash
provision_details:
  - site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/SAN JOSE/SJ_BLD23
    management_ip_address: 204.192.3.40
    provisioning: True
```

Upon successfull completion, the output will be.


"msg": "Provisioning of the device '204.192.3.40' completed successfully.",
"response": "Provisioning of the device '204.192.3.40' completed successfully."

## Site Assignment:
#### Assign a device to a site without provision. set provisioning: False

Step1: The device is not assigned to any site or provisioned 

![alt text](images/Device_in_initial_state.png)
    
Step2: Execute the site assignment playbook. Upon successful completion, the device is assigned to a site

Device site assignment details can be verified

## Device Re_Provision:
#### Re-provision an already provisioned device.

Step1: The device is in a provisioned state

Step2: After the reprovision operation successful

Upon successful completion, the output will be.


"msg": "Re-Provision for device '137.1.1.8' done successfully",
"response": "Wired Device '137.1.1.8' re-provisioning completed successfully."

## Device Un_Provision:
#### Un_provision the provisioned device.

Step1: The device is in provisioned state

![alt text](images/Device_is_already_provision.png)

Step2: After the unprovision operation, the device will be removed from the inventory

Upon successfull completetion, the playbook will return the following response


"msg": "Deletion done Successfully for the device '137.1.1.12' ",
"response": "Deletion done Successfully for the device '137.1.1.12' "


Use the following command to validate the input file against the schema:
```bash
#validates input file against the schema
