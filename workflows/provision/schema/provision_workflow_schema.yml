# false  ←
# Set to True to verify the Cisco Catalyst Center config after applying the playbook config.

# dnac_api_task_timeout
# integer
# Default:1200

# dnac_debug
# boolean
# Choices:
# true
# false  ←
# Indicates whether debugging is enabled in the Cisco Catalyst Center SDK.

# dnac_host
# string / required
# The hostname of the Cisco Catalyst Center.

# dnac_log
# boolean
# Choices:
# true
# false  ←
# Flag to enable/disable playbook execution logging.

# When true and dnac_log_file_path is provided, - Create the log file at the execution location with the specified name.

# When true and dnac_log_file_path is not provided, - Create the log file at the execution location with the name 'dnac.log'.

# When false, - Logging is disabled.

# If the log file doesn't exist, - It is created in append or write mode based on the "dnac_log_append" flag.

# If the log file exists, - It is overwritten or appended based on the "dnac_log_append" flag.

# dnac_log_append
# boolean
# Choices:
# true  ←
# false
# Determines the mode of the file. Set to True for 'append' mode. Set to False for 'write' mode.

# dnac_log_file_path
# string
# Default:dnac.log	
# Governs logging. Logs are recorded if dnac_log is True.

# If path is not specified, - When 'dnac_log_append' is True, 'dnac.log' is generated in the current Ansible directory; logs are appended. - When 'dnac_log_append' is False, 'dnac.log' is generated; logs are overwritten.

# If path is specified, - When 'dnac_log_append' is True, the file opens in append mode. - When 'dnac_log_append' is False, the file opens in write (w) mode. - In shared file scenarios, without append mode, content is overwritten after each module execution. - For a shared log file, set append to False for the 1st module (to overwrite); for subsequent modules, set append to True.

# dnac_log_level
