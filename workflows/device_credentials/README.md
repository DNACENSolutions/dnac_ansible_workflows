# Device Credential Workflow Manager
This Ansible workflow automates the management of device credentials within your network using Cisco DNA Center.

## Purpose

### Centralized Credential Management 

- Streamline the process of adding, updating, and deleting device credentials from a single location.

### Improved Security 

- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access by ensuring credentials are securely stored and managed.

### Workflow Automation 

- Simplify credential management tasks with an automated workflow, saving time and minimizing errors.

## Compatibility

### Cisco DNA Center 

- 2.3.3.0 and above

### Ansible 

- Latest stable version recommended

## Workflow Details
The workflow leverages the **device_credential_workflow_manager**  module to interact with DNA Center's credential management APIs. It supports the following operations:

### Add Device Credential 

- Create new device credentials.

### Update Device Credential 

- Modify existing credentials (e.g., change passwords).

### Delete Device Credential 

- Remove credentials from DNA Center.

### Assign or Update Credentials to Sites

- Assign clredentials to sites, Update new credentials to sites. 

### Apply Credentials

- Make update to creedentials, i.e. reset passsword etc and Apply to applicable sites and all the devices on that site.

## Procedure

### Prepare your Ansible environment

- Install Ansible if you haven't already
- Ensure you have network connectivity to your Catalyst Center instance.
- Checkout the project and playbooks:
>git@github.com:cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-ansible-iac.git

### Configure Host Inventory

- Update hosts.yml (or your preferred inventory file) with the connection details for your DNA Center instance.
 - The **host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml** file specifies the connection details (IP address, credentials, etc.) for your Catalyst Center instance.

```yaml
---
catalyst_center_hosts:
    hosts:
        catalyst_center220:
            dnac_host: xx.xx.xx.xx.
            dnac_password: XXXXXXXX
            dnac_port: 443
            dnac_timeout: 60
            dnac_username: admin
            dnac_verify: false
            dnac_version: 2.3.7.6
            dnac_debug: true
            dnac_log_level: INFO
            dnac_log: true
```

### Generate your Input

- Create a YAML file (e.g., vars.yml) to store the required variables for the workflow.
- Refer to the **device_credential_workflow_manager** module documentation for details on the available variables and their formats.
- Example:
 - The **workflows/device_config_backup/vars/device_config_backup_workflow_input.yml** file should be configured with device details.
 - Refer to the full workflow specification for detailed instructions on the available options and their structure:[full workflow specification](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/cisco/dnac/content/module/device_configs_backup_workflow_manager)
- Operation: 
 - add
 - update 
 - delete

```yaml
---
catalyst_center_version: 2.3.7.6
device_credentials:
  credentials_details: #Create multiple credentials for the same protocol
  - global_credential_details: #Create global credentials for the device list
      cli_credential: #Create CLI credentials list
      - description: CLI Sample 1
        username: cli-1
        password: "5!meh"
        enable_password: "q4^t^"
      - description: CLI2
        username: cli-2
        password: "sbs2@"
        enable_password: "8b!rn"
  credentials_site_assignment: #Assign credentials to sites list of all sites mappings
  - assign_credentials_to_site: # Assign device credentials to sites
      cli_credential: #Assign CLI credentials to sites
        description: CLI Sample 1
        username:  cli-1
```

### Validate Input:(recommended)

Validate the input with schema using yamale

```bash
dnac_ansible_workflows % yamale -s workflows/device_credentials/schema/device_credentials_schema.yml workflows/device_credentials/vars/device_credentials_vars.yml
Validating /Users/pawansi/dnac_ansible_workflows/workflows/device_credentials/vars/device_credentials_vars.yml...
Validation success! üëç
```

## Example run

- Collect device running configurations through Catalyst Center APIs.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml workflows/device_credentials/playbook/device_credentials_playbook.yml --e VARS_FILE_PATH=../vars/device_credentials_vars.yml -vvvv
```

## Important Notes:
- Ensure the Catalyst Center version is compatible.
- Carefully configure inventory and input variables.
- Validate input using yamale to prevent errors.
- Review execution logs for troubleshooting.
