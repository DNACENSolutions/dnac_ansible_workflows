# Assurance Health Score Settings Playbook
## Module Reference

Playbook for workflow Module: `assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager`

## Overview

This module provides resource management for assurance Health score settings in Cisco Catalyst Center.


**Description:** 
This module provides capabilities to configure and manage Assurance Health Score settings in Cisco Catalyst Center. It enables fine-tuned health monitoring by adjusting KPI thresholds and device-level scoring logic. Key features include:
  - **Health Score Configuration:**
    - Update and manage health score calculation parameters.
    - Define KPI thresholds and scoring rules specific to network device types.
    - Customize health scoring behavior based on operational priorities.

  - **Device-Specific Customization:**
    - Assign unique health score configurations per device type (e.g., access, core, distribution).
    - Control how individual KPIs influence the overall device health score.

  - **KPI Inclusion/Exclusion:**
    - Exclude specific KPIs from health score calculation to avoid skewing device performance metrics.
    - Ensure that excluded KPIs do not impact score trends or alerting.

  - **Health Score Computation Logic:**
    - Calculates the overall health score using the lowest score among the included KPIs.
    - Reflects worst-case operational scenarios for more conservative monitoring.

  - **Third-Party Device Handling:**
    - Health score configuration is not applicable to third-party devices and is automatically bypassed.

**Version Added:**  
`6.32.0`

This README outlines the steps to use the Ansible playbooks for managing assurance Health score settings in Cisco Catalyst Center.

## Workflow Steps

This workflow typically involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Install and Generate Inventory

Before running the playbooks, ensure you have Ansible installed and the necessary collections for Cisco Catalyst Center.

1.  **Install Ansible:** Follow the official Ansible documentation for installation instructions.
2.  **Install Cisco Catalyst Center Collection:**
    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.dnac
    ```
3.  **Generate Inventory:** Create an Ansible inventory file (e.g., `inventory.yml`) that includes your Cisco Catalyst Center appliance details. You will need to define variables such as the host, username, and password (or other authentication methods).
    ```yaml
    catalyst_center_hosts:
        hosts:
            your_catalyst_center_instance_name:
                catalyst_center_host: xx.xx.xx.xx
                catalyst_center_password: XXXXXXXX
                catalyst_center_port: 443
                catalyst_center_timeout: 60
                catalyst_center_username: admin
                catalyst_center_verify: false # Set to true for production with valid certificates
                catalyst_center_version: 2.3.7.9 # Specify your DNA Center version
                catalyst_center_debug: true
                catalyst_center_log_level: INFO
                catalyst_center_log: true
    ```

### Step 2: Define Inputs and Validate

This step involves preparing the input data for configuring Assurance Health Score Settings and validating the KPI thresholds per device type.

1.  **Define Input Variables:** Create the variable file at (e.g., `workflows/assurance_health_score_settings/vars/assurance_health_score_settings_inputs.yml`). This file should contain the list of KPI names and threshold values for various device types that you want to configure.

2.  **Review Structure and Options:** Refer to the full workflow specification for detailed instructions on the available options and their structure: https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/cisco/dnac/content/module/assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager/

**Validate Configuration:** 
To ensure a successful execution of the playbooks with your specified inputs, follow these steps:

    **Input Validation**:
    Before executing the playbook, it is essential to validate the input schema. This step ensures that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted. Run the following command *./tools/validate.sh -s* to perform the validation providing the schema path -d and the input path.

```bash
./tools/validate.sh -s ./workflows/assurance_health_score_settings/schema/assurance_health_score_settings_schema.yml -d ./workflows/assurance_health_score_settings/vars/assurance_health_score_settings_inputs.yml
```

### Deploy and Verify

This is the final step where you deploy the configuration to Cisco Catalyst Center and verify the changes.

**Deploy Configuration:** 

Run the playbook to seamlessly apply the wireless network profile configuration defined in your input variables to Cisco Catalyst Center. 
Before proceeding, ensure that the input validation step has been completed successfully, with no errors detected in the provided variables. Once validated, execute the playbook by specifying the input file path using the --e variable as VARS_FILE_PATH. The VARS_FILE_PATH must be provided as a full path to the input file.
This ensures that the configuration is accurately deployed to Cisco Catalyst Center, automating the setup process and reducing the risk of manual errors.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/demo_lab/hosts.yaml ./workflows/assurance_health_score_settings/playbook/assurance_health_score_settings_playbook.yml --extra-vars VARS_FILE_PATH=./../vars/assurance_health_score_settings_inputs.yml -vvvvvv    
```

If there is an error in the input or an issue with the API call during execution, the playbook will halt and display the relevant error details.
