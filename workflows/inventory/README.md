# Ansible Workflow: Inventory Workflow Manager

This Ansible workflow automates various inventory management tasks within your network, streamlining device and port configuration.

inventory_details defines the list of devices and device details for the devices to be run through the playbooks.

This workflow playbook is used for adding devices, assign devices to sites and provision, updating the devices, resync and reboot the devices, changing device roles and Deleteing the devices in Inventory.

# Procedure
1. ## Prepare your Ansible environment:

Install Ansible if you haven't already
Ensure you have network connectivity to your Catalyst Center instance.
Checkout the project and playbooks: git@github.com:cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-ansible-iac.git

2. ## Configure Host Inventory:

The host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml file specifies the connection details (IP address, credentials, etc.) for your Catalyst Center instance.
Make sure the dnac_version in this file matches your actual Catalyst Center version.
##The Sample host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml

```bash
catalyst_center_hosts:
    hosts:
        catalyst_center220:
            dnac_host: xx.xx.xx.xx.
            dnac_password: XXXXXXXX
            dnac_port: 443
            dnac_timeout: 60
            dnac_username: admin
            dnac_verify: false
            dnac_version: 2.3.7.6
            dnac_debug: true
            dnac_log_level: INFO
            dnac_log: true
```
## Description of Vars in `hosts.yml`

    - **dnac_host**: IP address of the Catalyst Center.  
    - **dnac_username**: Catalyst Center login username.  
    - **dnac_password**: Catalyst Center login password.  
    - **dnac_version**: Catalyst Center version.  
    - **dnac_port**: Port number to which Catalyst Center listens.  
    - **dnac_timeout**: Timeout for API requests made to Catalyst Center.  
    - **dnac_verify**: Indicates whether to verify the SSL certificate of Catalyst Center.  
    - **dnac_debug**: Enables or disables debug mode.  
    - **dnac_log**: Enables or disables logging for Catalyst Center. 

3. ## Define Playbook input:

The workflow/inventory/vars/inventory_vars.yaml file stores the device details you want to add to catalyst center.
Refer to the full workflow specification for detailed instructions on the available options and their structure: https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/cisco/dnac/content/module/inventory_workflow_manager/
```bash
