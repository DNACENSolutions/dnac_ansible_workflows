## Overview

The Backup and Restore workflow automates data protection and disaster recovery operations for Cisco Catalyst Center. It provides NFS storage configuration, encrypted backups with retention policies, and system restoration capabilities.

---

## Features

- **Backup Creation**: Timestamped or fixed-name backups with configurable scope
- **Storage Management**: NFS configuration with encryption and retention (3-60 number of backups to retain)
- **Deletion Strategies**: Remove backups by name, retention policy, or all at once
- **Disaster Recovery**: Restore from encrypted backups
- **Idempotent Operations**: Prevent duplicate backups with fixed naming

### Installation and Run (Aligned)

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.catalystcenter --force
```

2. Provide workflow inputs in either inventory (`inventory/demo_lab/hosts.yaml`) or the workflow `vars/` file.

3. Export Catalyst Center environment variables and run the playbook.

```bash
export HOSTIP=<catalyst-center-ip-or-fqdn>
export CATALYST_CENTER_USERNAME=<username>
export CATALYST_CENTER_PASSWORD='<password>'
ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/demo_lab/hosts.yaml ./workflows/backup_and_restore/playbook/backup_and_restore_playbook.yml -vvvv
```


## Operations

### Create Operations (state: merged)

Use `backup_and_restore_playbook.yml` for all creation and restore operations.

#### NFS Configuration

1.Create NFS Configuration

Network File System (NFS) server, which will serve as the designated storage for Cisco Catalyst Center's system backups and facilitates restore operations.

```yaml
backup_restore_details:
  - nfs_configuration:
      - server_ip: 172.27.17.90
        source_path: /home/nfsshare/backups/TB23
        nfs_port: 2049
        nfs_version: nfs4
        nfs_portmapper_port: 111
```
![alt text](./images/image.png)
![alt text](./images/image-1.png)

#### Backup Storage Configuration

2.Create Backup Storage Configuration 

The backup storage configuration defines where and how backup data will be stored, serving solely to prepare the storage infrastructure rather than creating or executing the backups themselves.

```yaml
backup_restore_details:
  - backup_storage_configuration:
      - server_type: NFS
        nfs_details:
          server_ip: 172.27.17.90
          source_path: /home/nfsshare/backups/TB23
        data_retention_period: 3
        encryption_passphrase: "SecurePass123!"
```

![alt text](./images/image-2.png)

#### Create Backup

3.Create Backup 

**Timestamped Backup** (always creates new):

```yaml
backup_restore_details:
  - backup:
      - name: DAILY_BACKUP
        scope: CISCO_DNA_DATA_WITH_ASSURANCE
        generate_new_backup: true
```

![alt text](./images/image-3.png)

Result: `DAILY_BACKUP_20241230_143052`

**Fixed Name Backup** (idempotent):

```yaml
backup_restore_details:
  - backup:
      - name: WEEKLY_BACKUP
        scope: CISCO_DNA_DATA_WITH_ASSURANCE
        generate_new_backup: false
```

Result: `WEEKLY_BACKUP` (no duplicate if exists)

#### Restore Backup

4.Restore Backup

Restoring data from previously created backups

⚠️ **System will reboot during restoration**

```yaml
backup_restore_details:
  - restore_operations:
      - name: DAILY_BACKUP_20241230_143052
        encryption_passphrase: "SecurePass123!"
```


**Validate**
Validate Configuration: To ensure a successful execution of the playbooks with your specified inputs, follow these steps:
Input Validation: Before executing the playbook, it is essential to validate the input schema. This step ensures that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted. Run the following command ./tools/validate.sh -s to perform the validation providing the schema path -d and the input path.


```bash
# Validate

./tools/validate.sh   -s workflows/backup_and_restore/schema/backup_and_restore_schema.yml   -d workflows/backup_and_restore/vars/backup_and_restore_inputs.yml

## Inventory / group_vars Example

You can also run this workflow without `VARS_FILE_PATH` by moving the sample workflow data into inventory, `host_vars`, or `group_vars`.

1. Create an inventory vars file such as `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` or `inventory/host_vars/<host>.yml`.
2. Copy the sample workflow data from `workflows/backup_and_restore/vars/backup_and_restore_inputs.yml` into that inventory vars file.
3. Keep the same top-level variable name in inventory: `backup_restore_details`.
4. Run the playbook without `VARS_FILE_PATH`:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i <inventory-file> workflows/backup_and_restore/playbook/backup_and_restore_playbook.yml -vvvv
```
