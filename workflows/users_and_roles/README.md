# User Profile Roles and Permissions
Catalyst Center supports role-based access control (RBAC). The roles assigned to a user profile define the capabilities that a user has permission to perform. Catalyst Center has three main default user roles:
SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE
NETWORK-ADMIN-ROLE
OBSERVER-ROLE
The SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE gives users broad capabilities and permits them to perform all actions in the Catalyst Center GUI, including creating custom roles and assigning them to user profiles. The NETWORK-ADMIN-ROLE and the OBSERVER-ROLE have more limited and restricted capabilities in the Catalyst Center GUI.
# Configure Role-Based Access Control
Catalyst Center supports role-based access control (RBAC), which enables a user with SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE privileges to define custom roles that permit or restrict user access to certain Catalyst Center functions.

Use this procedure to define a custom role and then assign a user to that role.

## Before you begin
Only a user with SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE permissions can perform this procedure.

## Procedure
### Step 1 Define a custom role.
In role_details Section define the custome roles with necessary permissions.
for Reference check sample inputs at vars/users_and_roles_workflow_inputs.yml
```bash
  role_details:
    - role_name: Assurance-role
      description: With write access overall
      assurance:
        - overall: write
          monitoring_and_troubleshooting: read

```
### Step 2 To assign a user to the custom role you just created
Under users details add your users with role list give the list of all roles listed.
```bash
  user_details:
    - username: xxxxxxx
      first_name: Pawan
      last_name: Singh
      email: xxxxxxw@example.com
      password: xxxxx@123!45
      role_list: 
        - Admin_customized_role
        - Assurance-role
```

ansible-playbook -i host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml workflows/users_and_roles/playbook/users_and_roles_workflow_playbook.yml --e VARS_FILE_PATH=../vars/users_and_roles_workflow_inputs.yml -vvvv

##Example run: Delete Users and Role

ansible-playbook -i host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml workflows/users_and_roles/playbook/delete_users_and_roles_workflow_playbook.yml --e VARS_FILE_PATH=../vars/users_and_roles_workflow_inputs.yml -vvvv

        catalyst_center220:
            dnac_host: xx.xx.xx.xx.
            dnac_password: XXXXXXXX
            dnac_port: 443

            dnac_log: true
```
User Inputs for Users and roles are stored in  workflows/users_and_roles/vars/users_and_roles_workflow_inputs.yml

##Validate user input before running though ansible
```bash
    (pyats)  dnac_ansible_workflows % ./tools/validate.sh -s workflows/users_and_roles/schema/users_and_roles_workflow_schema.yml -d workflows/users_and_roles/vars/users_and_roles_workflow_inputs.yml
