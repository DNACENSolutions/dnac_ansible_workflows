This README outlines the steps to use the Ansible playbooks for managing Application Policies in Cisco Catalyst Center.

## Workflow Steps

This workflow follows a three-step approach:

### Step 1: Install and Generate Inventory

Before running the playbooks, ensure you have Ansible installed and the necessary collections for Cisco Catalyst Center.

1.  **Install Ansible:** Follow the official Ansible documentation for installation instructions.
2.  **Install Cisco Catalyst Center Collection:**
    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.dnac
    ```
3.  **Generate Inventory:** Create an Ansible inventory file (e.g., `inventory.yml`) that includes your Cisco Catalyst Center appliance details. You will need to define variables such as the host, username, and password (or other authentication methods).
### Configure Host Inventory
Update your Ansible hosts.yml inventory file with the connection details of your Cisco Catalyst Center instance. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Catalyst Center information.
```yaml
catalyst_center_hosts:
    hosts:
        your_catalyst_center_instance_name:
            catalyst_center_host: xx.xx.xx.xx
            catalyst_center_password: XXXXXXXX
            catalyst_center_port: 443
            catalyst_center_timeout: 60
            catalyst_center_username: admin
            catalyst_center_verify: false # Set to true for production with valid certificates
            catalyst_center_version: 2.3.7.6 # Specify your DNA Center version
            catalyst_center_debug: true
            catalyst_center_log_level: INFO
            catalyst_center_log: true
```

### Step 2: Define Create Inputs, and Validate

This step involves preparing the input data for creating or managing application policies and validating your setup.

1.  **Define Input Variables:** Create variable files (e.g., `vars/application_policies.yml`) that define the desired state of your application policies, applications, queuing profiles, etc. Refer to the specific playbook documentation for the required variable structure.
```yaml

#Select Catalyst Cennter version, this one overwrite the default version from host file
catalyst_center_version: 2.3.7.6
# This file contains the variables for the inventory workflow

            - relevance: "DEFAULT"
              application_set_name: ["collaboration-apps","tunneling", "general-media"]

```

2.  **Validate Configuration:** You can use yamale to validate the input against the schema

    ```bash
yamale -s workflows/application_policy/schema/application_policy_schema.yml workflows/application_policy/vars/application_policy_inputs.yml
Validating workflows/application_policy/vars/application_policy_inputs.yml...
Validation success! üëç

    ```

### Step 3: Deploy and Verify

This is the final step where you deploy the configuration to Cisco Catalyst Center and verify the changes.

1.  **Deploy Configuration:** Run the playbooks to apply the configuration defined in your input variables to Cisco Catalyst Center.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook create_application_policy.yml -i inventory.yml -e VARS_FILE_PATH=<Path to your variables file>
    ```
