# How to execute playbook:

# Procedure
1. ## Prepare your Ansible environment:

Install Ansible if you haven't already
Ensure you have network connectivity to your Catalyst Center instance.
Checkout the project and playbooks: git@github.com:cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-ansible-iac.git

2. ## Configure Host Inventory:

The host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml file specifies the connection details (IP address, credentials, etc.) for your Catalyst Center instance.
Make sure the dnac_version in this file matches your actual Catalyst Center version.
##The Sample host_inventory_dnac1/hosts.yml

```bash
catalyst_center_hosts:
    hosts:
        catalyst_center220:
            dnac_host: xx.xx.xx.xx.
            dnac_password: XXXXXXXX
            dnac_port: 443
            dnac_timeout: 60
            dnac_username: admin
            dnac_verify: false
            dnac_version: 2.3.7.6
            dnac_debug: true
            dnac_log_level: INFO
            dnac_log: true
```
